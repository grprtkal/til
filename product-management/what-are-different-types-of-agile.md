# What are different types of Agile practices? 

1. **Extreme Programming (XP)**: Very, very fast cycles of programming and communication with users; usually two programmers working simultaneously; extensive code review and unit tests; philosophy is: don't code until it is a must-have 
2. **Kanban**: Everyone pitches in on very focused set of tasks and does QA; limit work in progress to match capacity; quick cycle time; based on Toyota's just-in-time system; no fixed length sprint
3. **Scrum**: Fixed-length sprints; asses previous sprint while planning next
