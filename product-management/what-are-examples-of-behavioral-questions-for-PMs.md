# Behavioral questions
> Behavioral questons have two goals: Who are you? And, how well do you communicate? 

Tell me about a time when ... 
- you had to persuade someone to do something? 
- you had a disagreement with a colleague? 
- you had to prioritize many tasks? 

Structure is key: 
1. Context/Setup
2. Action 
3. Result 

# Other questions
1. What is your favorite product and why? 

Example: Shyp -- good problem to solve; onboarding easy; each step of the process is clear and painless; user experience great (whimsy and fun) 

Note: don't talk too much about yourself; get inside the head of your user

2. How do you talk to engineers? 

Understand their stack and the technical world they live in; curious and not afraid to dive in; understand each engineer's work style
