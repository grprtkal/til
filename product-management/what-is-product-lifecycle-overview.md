2. Plan - write out a PRD; figure out how much effort it takes 
3. Develop - build it; waterfall vs. agile
4. Evaluate - evaluate whether it's solving the problem we are aiming to solve; do user testing
5. Launch - release to users 
6. Assess - measure success of product launch including the product itself and the process of the product lifecycle; get customer feedback
